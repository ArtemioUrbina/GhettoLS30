# GhettoLS30

  The idea is to use the extra buttons on 
  a kick harness and an Arduino Mega to 
  rotate as an LS-30 via two buttons.
  
  The third button is used constant rotation
  and pulse rotation (default).

  The LCD shield is not mandatoiry, only used
  fo enable and disable the protection for 
  Guevara/Guerilla War. This can also be changed
  with the variable as commented at teh start of
  the code.
