# GhettoLS30

  The idea is to use the extra buttons on 
  a kick harness and an Arduino Mega to 
  rotate as an LS-30 via two buttons.
  
  The third button is used for constant rotation
  and pulse rotation (default).

  The LCD shield is not mandatory, it is only used
  to enable and disable the protection for 
  Guevara/Guerilla War. This can also be changed
  with a variable commented at the start of
  the source code.

# Features
  
  - Supports Guerilla War protection Mode
  - Has variable frame delay for constant rotation
  - Low cost and no extra Control Panel for a playable experience

# Cabling

All grounds must be connected
